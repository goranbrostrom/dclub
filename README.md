# D-club

These LaTeX files contain the Bridge bidding system 'D-club', inventor
Göran Broström (myself): gb(at)carlslid(dot)se

The system builds heavily on Mats Nilsland's and Anders Wirgren's *Super
Standard*, combined with 
a two-way 1 club opening: 9-11 hp, balanced, or 15+ hp, all distributions
(first and second hand).

The main file is 'dclub.tex', from where the rest is 'include'd.
