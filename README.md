# D-club

These LaTeX files contain the Bridge bidding system 'D-club', inventor
Göran Broström (myself): gb@carlslid.se

The system builds heavily on Mats Nilsland's Super Standard, combined with
a two-way 1 club opening: 9-11 hp, balanced, or 15+ hp, all distributions
(first and second hand).

The main file is 'dclub.tex', from where the rest is 'include'd.
